## Matthew Newkirk UW FinTech Part-Time 01/12/21 Unit 6 HW - Real Estate Dashboard

I didn't give myself enough time to adequately finish this one to my liking. Most notably, there are a couple bugs when compiling the final panel: the tab containing bar graphs displays incorrectly, likely due to custom axes ranges; and the tab containing the MapBox scatterplot has a strange error I didn't quite understand. Commenting out the map_tab tab in the final panel construction will allow the code to run without error, but the final dashboard panel is missing the correct data for th bar graphs and of course the entire MapBox scatterplot. All files submitted by 12:00am, other than this readme submitted at 12:09. :)
